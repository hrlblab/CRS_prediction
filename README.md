Predictive Modeling of Surgically Recalcitrant Chronic Rhinosinusitis Using Integrated Feature Sets

# Installation
<pre>pip install -r requirements.txt</pre>
# Usage
You can run `python number_prior_surgeries_final.py` for the multi-class classification task and run `python prior_surgeries_final.py` for the binary classification task.
There is also a combined version `run_all_auc_tasks.py` which you can use to automatically generate results for all four tasks.
The results generated by the code are stored in the `results_auc` folder, and `plot_result.py` can read these results for comparison.
